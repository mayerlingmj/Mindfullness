#### **_Description_**

##### A description of a project

Crystal therapy is based on the idea that specific stones, such amethyst, rose quartz, and jade, may connect with the human body's energy flow and realign the energy channels that are disrupting the natural flow of energy, allowing the body to cure itself. It is believed that your chakras are a source of subtle energy that facilitates optimal functioning of your organs, mind, and intelligence. Although chakras and spiritual energy have not been the subject of extensive scientific study, they may stimulate introspection about one's own psyche and physical being. The objective of this web App is to allow individuals the freedom to learn about healing methods but also have the ability to share their personal findinds.
